# Suggested Agenda for 2021-03-12

## Agenda Items
1. Status on P001 - P2SH
1. Status on P003 (currently an issue here: https://github.com/RavencoinFoundation/ravencoinfoundation.github.io/issues)
1. Status on P004 (currently an issue here: https://github.com/RavencoinFoundation/ravencoinfoundation.github.io/issues)
1. A fully flushed docs for ravencoin would be great, started converting the filecoin docs one.  Help is appreciated as there are only so many minutes in the day (https://github.com/corviato1/ravencoin-docs) 
1. For restricted assets; why are they limited to ten, and can the number be increased for better utilization of the network?
1. Update on the mobile wallet: Including getting the foundation(if not already) publishing rights to app stores as well as direct download links on the foundation website with checksum option and tutorial on foundation website on how to use checksum as well as all submitted [accurate] video tutorials on wallet utilization. *This should also exist for the qt*  There also needs to be a good pipeline for the foundation vetting submitted mobile wallets and media content.   These jobs would need to have their time quantified and a consensus of how the checks and balances should exist as well as compensation rate.  Shameless plug, I forked the android mobile wallet a while ago.  https://github.com/corviato1/ravenwallet-android  will pay 10 RVN, 100 PANDACOIN, and 100 CATE for each[non duplicate] issue/pull request for the rest of this month, and will consider extending this bounty request system for android mobile wallets.
